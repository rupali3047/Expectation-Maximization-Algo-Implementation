# Expectation-Maximization-Algo-Implementation
EM Algorithm

To Execute this program, follow these steps:-
(This program is written in Python 2.3.6, So python 2.3.6 is required to be installed(not higher version) )

Requirements :-
Python 2.3.6
Libraries Required - Scipy, Numpy, TKinter, Pylab, Math


1. Execute emtry.py file , this will start a command line argument
2. User has to input two things:-
   A) Number of points
   B) Number of Clusters

3. Then the EM algo will be implemented and the final plot will be plotted. Plot after each iteration will also be shown.
